# add-username-ui
Project #3 from 'React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)' By Maximilian Schwarzmüller.

Aim of project is to create a UI to enter usernames and ages via an input form and display them in a list below.
The UI also displays an Error modal if the entered input is invalid and prompts the user to correct it before re-submitting.

Incorporates core React concepts learnt during the course.
Built using 'create-react-app’ from the command line.
To run the code, first run 'npm install' to install the dependencies in your local environment. Then, run 'npm start' to start the development web server in browser on localhost:3000.
